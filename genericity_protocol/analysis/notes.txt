NOTES:

AURYD2FH3FUOQ did 10 extra HITS, but they maybe of poor quality(and need to be paid because of bad communication on my end). NOUN_DEV_TEST

A3IGFK1YNA4H9O did 15 extra HITS, but they seem to be of good quality(compared against the average). I'm going to approve them for now, but his confidence scores are just 4. I don't think that's an issue since many annotators might not use that anyway. NOUN_TRAIN
