# Protocol code and design for genericity annotation

This folder contains the styling and markup files for running the genericity protocol on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It also contains the code necessary to generate the .csv datafile that MTurk requires as input. To generate these datafiles, ensure that the scripts point to the current location of the [Universal Dependencies v1.2 dataset](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/releases/tag/r1.2). You are free to use the scripts and the markup files to rerun the protocol as is<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, or to generate your own protocol. For a detailed description of the protocol and data collected, or if you wish to use these scripts or protocol designs in a presentation or publication, we ask that you cite the following paper.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: PredPatt provides options for how it is supposed to extract arguments and predicates from text. One of the options is `cut`, which defines what to do with open clausal complements. With `cut=True`, PredPatt identifies the open clausal complement of predicates as a separate predicate. Hence different predicates will be highlighted for annotators depending on the value set for `cut`. We extracted predicates with both values of `cut`, so as to cover all possible predicates for annotation.
