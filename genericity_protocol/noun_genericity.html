    <h1>What is it?</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p class="instructions_intro">
      In this task, you will be presented with a sentence containing <span class="noun">a word highlighted in yellow</span> followed by questions about that word.
      We call the highlighted words <span class="noun">nouns</span>. Nouns can refer to particular things (or groups of things), like particular lions, particular chairs, particular
      ideas, or particular thoughts. But they can also refer to types of things – animal species (lion, dog, cat), kinds of inanimate things (chair, bottle, computer), etc. – or even
      very abstract concepts – wealth, power, justice, crime, etc.

      We are interested in distinguishing among the different sorts of things nouns refer to in a particular sentence, and so the questions you will be asked about the
      highlighted noun will be:

      <ol type="i">
        <li>whether the noun refers to a particular thing</li>
        <li>whether the noun refers to a type of thing</li>
         <li>whether the noun refers to an abstract concept</li>
      </ol>

      We give examples that will help you answer these questions below.

    </p>

    <h2>How the task works</h2>

    <p class="instructions_intro">
        The first question is about whether the noun refers to a particular thing.

        An example of a noun referring to a particular thing can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>That <span class="noun">lion</span> likes to play with her food.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">lion</span> refers to a particular lion that likes to play with her food.

        An example of a noun referring to a particular group of things can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>The <span class="noun">lions</span> roared in unison.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">lions</span> refers to a particular group of things: a group of lions engaging in the act of roaring.

        <!-- We don't necessarily need to know exactly which thing or group of things a noun refers to

        <blockquote><span class="noun">A lion</span> escaped from his enclosure the other day.</blockquote>

        <span class="noun">lion</span> <b>is</b> a particular noun in this sentence, since it refers to a specific lion which escaped. -->

        Not all nouns refer to physical things, but that doesn't mean they don't refer to particular things. An example of a noun referring to
        a particular non-physical thing can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>That <span class="noun">idea</span> is stupid.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">idea</span> refers to a particular non-physical thing.

        <!-- <blockquote><span class="noun">Lions</span> eat meat.</blockquote>
        <span class="noun">Lions</span> <b>is not</b> a particular noun in this sentence, since the sentence does not talk about any specific lion(or lions). It talks about lions in general.

        <blockquote><span class="noun">Wealth</span> is concentrated among the rich.</blockquote>
        <span class="noun">Wealth</span> <b>is not</b> particular noun in this sentence, since it talks about wealth in general. -->

        The second question is about whether the noun refers to a type of thing.

        An example of a noun referring to a type of thing can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote><span class="noun">Lions</span> eat meat.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">lions</span> refers to lions in general – not any particular lion.

        Not all nouns that refer to types of things refer to animal species.  An example of this can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>Coke <span class="noun">bottles</span> have long necks.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">bottles</span> refers to Coke bottles in general – not any particular Coke bottle.

        Nouns that refer to types of things can come in various forms. For instance, we can also talk about Coke bottles in general using the following sentence:

        <blockquote>The Coke <span class="noun">bottle</span> has changed shape many times over the years.</blockquote>

        In this case, you should also answer that the noun <span class="noun">bottle</span> refers to a type of thing.

        The third question is about whether the noun refers to an abstract concept.

        An example of a noun referring to an abstract concept can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote><span class="noun">Corruption</span> is rampant in Washington.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the noun <span class="noun">corruption</span> doesn't refer to particular thing or group of things, nor does it refer to a type of thing.
        Rather, it refers directly to the abstract concept of corruption.

        Sometimes it will be difficult to tell what a noun refers to. Consider the following sentence:

        <blockquote>The <span class="noun">service</span> is bad at that restaurant.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, it seems reasonable to say that the noun <span class="noun">service</span> refers to a particular thing – service at that restaurant.
        But it also seems reasonable to say that it refers to a type of thing, which encompasses all the different acts of service carried out at the restaurant.
        It could even be that the noun <span class="noun">service</span> refers to an abstract concept of service more generally, since service at a restaurant
        can involve lots of different types of things mashed together – how nice the waiters are, the ambiance of the restaurant, quality of the food, etc. –
        that we wouldn't naturally call one type of thing.

        For this reason, we've provided a drop-down menu to input your confidence about your answer for each of the three questions.
