    <div class="instructions_intro">
    <span class="alert">Please read the instructions even if you have attempted the survey before as the instructions have changed</span>
    <h1>What is going on?</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="instructions_intro">
        In this task, you will be presented with a sentence containing <span class="predicate">a word highlighted in yellow</span> followed by questions about that word.
        We call these words predicates. Predicates refer to some kind of <span class="terminology">situation</span> — for example, a dynamic event (like <span class="predicate">run</span> or <span class="predicate">think</span>) or a state of being (like <span class="predicate">know</span> or <span class="predicate">love</span>). We're interested in two properties of the different situations that predicates can refer to:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>whether the predicate describes a <span class="terminology">hypothetical</span> situation or situations</li>
            <li>whether the predicate describes a <span class="terminology">particular</span> situation or a group of particular situations</li>
            <li>whether the predicate describes a <span class="terminology">dynamic</span> situation or situations</li>
        </ol>

        We give examples that will help you answer these two questions below.

    </p>

    <h2>How the task works</h2>
    <h4><a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('all_examples'))">Click here to hide/show all examples</a></h4>
    <div id="all_examples" style="display: block">
    <p class="instructions_intro">
        The first question is about whether the predicate describes a hypothetical situation, or hypothetical situations.

        <h4><a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('hyp_examples'))">Examples of hypothetical situations (click to hide/show)</a></h4>
        <div id="hyp_examples" style="display: block" class="instructions_examples">
        An example of a hypothetical situation is found in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>If Jo is <span class="predicate">running</span> a half marathon tomorrow, she should get lots of rest tonight.</blockquote>

        In this case, the predicate <span class="predicate">running</span> describes a hypothetical situation - Jo may or may not run a marathon tomorrow. Notice that only the situation corresponding to the predicate <span class="predicate">running</span>  is answered. The hypothetical situation of Jo getting lot of rest is not described by the same predicate.

        Another example of a predicate describing a hypothetical situation is <span class="predicate">know</span> in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>Bo might <span class="predicate">know</span> French.</blockquote>

        The predicate <span class="predicate">know</span> refers to a hypothetical situation(or world) where Bo knows French. Perhaps Bo does know French, or he doesn't, but the situation described in the sentence leaves that unclear.

        Sometimes, a predicate can describe more than one particular situation. For example:

        <blockquote>The men may be <span class="predicate">eating</span> dinner at their homes.</blockquote>

        The predicate <span class="predicate">eating</span> refers to a group of hypothetical situations - the situation where each man eats dinner at his home.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes it'll be difficult to tell if the situation described by the predicate is hypothetical or not. For this reason, we've provided a drop-down menu to input your confidence about your answer.
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- SECOND QUESTION -->
        The second question is about whether the predicate describes a particular situation or situations. A particular situation has a particular time and place associated with it (even though you may not be able to tell exactly which time and place that is from the sentence).

        </br>
        <h4><a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('part_examples'))">Examples of particular situations (click to hide/show)</a></h4>
        <div id="part_examples" style="display: block" class="instructions_examples">
        An example of a predicate referring to a particular situation can be seen in the following example:

        <blockquote>The lion was <span class="predicate">eating</span> a zebra.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the predicate <span class="predicate">eating</span> refers to a particular situation; the author of the sentence is saying that there is a particular time in the past when the lion was eating a zebra. Even though we can't be sure of the location associated with the situation , we can be sure that it <b>definitely happened at a particular location</b>.

        <br><br>
        Sometimes, a predicate can describe more than one particular situation.  An example of this can be seen in the following sentence:

        <blockquote>The boys each <span class="predicate">ate</span> a steak.</blockquote>

        In this sentence, the predicate <span class="predicate">ate</span> doesn't refer to one particular situation. Instead, it refers to a group of particular situations – one eating for each boy.
        For the purposes of answering whether the predicate refers to a particular situation, we would like you to group predicates that refer to one particular situation and predicates that refer to a group of particular situations together.
        <br>
        Not all predicates refer to particular situation or group of particular situations. Take the following example.

        <blockquote>Lions <span class="predicate">eat</span> meat.</blockquote>

        The predicate <span class="predicate">eat</span> doesn't describe a particular situation of eating, or even a group of particular situations. Instead, <span class="predicate">eat</span> describes a general property of most lions you would come across: that they eat meat. There is no particular time, or particular place associated with <span class="predicate">eat</span> in this sentence.

        <br><br>
        Predicates can also refer to generalizations of particular things, but that doesn't mean that they refer to a particular situation or particular situations. For example:

        <blockquote>Claire <span class="predicate">eats</span> steak for dinner every Friday.</blockquote>

        The predicate <span class="predicate">eats</span> doesn't refer to a particular situation or a group of particular situations. Rather it describes a habit of Claire - that she generally eats steak for dinner on Fridays. Here, there is a place and time associated with <span class="predicate">eats</span>, however it is <b>not a particular time and place</b>. 

        <br><br>
        Predicates can refer to hypothetical situations and still be particular. For example:

        <blockquote>If Jo is <span class="predicate">running</span> a half marathon tomorrow, she should get lots of rest tonight.</blockquote>

        It was mentioned that the predicate <span class="predicate">running</span> refers to a hypothetical situation. However, the predicate alo refers to a particular situation - the hypothetical situation where Bo may run a half marathon. Running takes place in a particular time and place(even if it not clear from the sentence)
        <br><br>
        However, hypothetical situations can also be non-particular as in the other example given:

        <blockquote>Bo might <span class="predicate">know</span> French.</blockquote>

        Again, the predicate <span class="predicate">know</span> refers to a hypothetical situation. However, it doesn't refer to a particular situation. Knowing something isn't assoicated with any time and place, it describes a general property of Bo that may or may not be true.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes it'll be difficult to tell whether or not a predicate refers to a particular situation or group of situations. For this reason, we've provided a drop-down menu to input your confidence about your answer.
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- THIRD QUESTION -->
        The third question is about whether the predicate describes a dynamic situation. A dynamic situation is one that we can say <b>happened</b>.
        They will often involve physical activities, like running or kicking, but they can also involve mental activities like thinking or wondering.
        </br>
        <h4><a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('dyn_examples'))">Examples of dynamic situations (click to hide/show)</a></h4>
        <div id="dyn_examples" style="display: block" class="instructions_examples">
        For example, the predicate <span class="predicate">running</span> in the following sentence describes a dynamic situation:

        <blockquote>Jo is <span class="predicate">running</span> a half marathon tomorrow.</blockquote>

        Another example of a predicate describing a dynamic situation is <span class="predicate">thought</span> in the following sentence.

        <blockquote>Bo <span class="predicate">thought</span> about Mo.</blockquote>

        Dynamic situations do not always need to unfold over time, as running and thinking do. For example, the predicate <span class="predicate">won</span> in the sentence below describes a dynamic situation that takes place instantaneously:

        <blockquote>Mo <span class="predicate">won</span> the race.</blockquote>

        Not all predicates are dynamic – for example, the predicate <span class="predicate">owns</span> in the following sentence does not describe a dynamic situation:

        <blockquote>Jo <span class="predicate">owns</span> a car.</blockquote>

        Unlike situations like running or thinking, we don't say that owning something <b>happens</b>. It simply describes a state - Jo's ownership of a car. Predicates that describe mental states can also be non-dynamic. For example, <span class="predicate">believes</span> in the sentence below does not describe a dynamic situation:

        <blockquote>Bo <span class="predicate">believes</span> in Mo.</blockquote>

        Notice that this sentence looks a lot like the one involving the predicate <span class="predicate">thought</span> above. It's different because We don't say believing in someone happened, whereas we do say that thinking about someone happens.
        <br><br>

<!--         A particular situation can be dynamic and non-dynamic, and so can a non-particular situation. An example of a non-particular, dynamic situation is:

        <blockquote>Lions <span class="predicate">eat</span> meat.</blockquote>        
        The situation described by <span class="predicate">eat</span> is dynamic, since it can be said to have happened. An example of particular, non-dynamic situation is:

        <blockquote>Lions <span class="predicate">eat</span> meat.</blockquote> -->
    
        Sometimes it'll be difficult to tell if the predicate is dynamic or not. For this reason, we've provided a drop-down menu to input your confidence about your answer.
